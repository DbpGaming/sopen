Simple script to open files with their correct program by extension, made for plumbing.

also automagically deal with lzma'd roms for emulator usage.

periods in the rom file name can break save file copying on any emulator using .sav files, .srm has to be from smc and sfc roms with a fixed extension width so i was able to bugfix it there.
